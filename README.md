## Drafting

Current thought is that we will start with a fixed league size, say 6. Members of the league will do a draft before the season starts. For now, we will focus on the spring season.

League members will draft x number of team race teams, and y number of diviosonal teams. By divisional teams I mean, for example, "Tufts A", or "MIT B". Current thinking is 2 or 3 TR teams (x), 5 or 6 divisional teams (y) where 1 of the TR teams is on the bench and 1 or 2 of the divisonal teams are also on the bench.

Draft a womens division or two as well.


## Scoring
### Divisional Scoring (Fleet Racing)
Scores for each divisional team will be based on the average score per race. However, we need to figure out some way to factor in the number of teams entered in the regatta. So someone who gets 1st and averages 3rd in an 18 boat regatta should receive more points than someoen who gets 1st and averages 3rd in a 14 boat regatta.

Also need to include

## Parsing and Reading Data
Parsing is going to be really annoying because each regatta page has a unique link name. For example the Co-ed Showcase regatta has name "/coed-showcase/". The Captain Hurst has the name "/captain-hurst-bowl/", the Danmark Trophy is "/danmark/", etc.

Thinking we might have to input a schedule ahead of time, and guess the the names of the regatta pages, or update them each week.
